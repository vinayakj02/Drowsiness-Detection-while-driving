# Drowsiness-Detection-while-driving
Course Project for IT204 

Drowsiness while driving is a highly prevalent prob-lem that leads to thousands of fatal accidents every year. Asolution to prevent accidents and fatalities is the need of thehour and while there are complex systems developed that providesolutions for detecting drowsiness in drivers, our project exploresa simpler, yet highly effective method of doing the same. Inthis project, a drowsy driver detection system is designed usingPython,OpenCV and Mediapipe. Mediapipe is a cross-platformlibrary developed by Google that provides ready-to-use MLsolutions for computer vision tasks. The proposed system gave a maximum recognition accuracy of96.55 percent and a best precision score of 91.66 for dataset videoinput.
